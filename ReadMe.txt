Reconstruction:
1. Run 'DataPreProcess.m' for data preprocess. Including cutting, resizing, and background subtraction.
2. Run 'ASPMReconstruction.m' for reconstruction.

About Data folder:
There are modulation data, modulated image and reference image.
Modulation data: modulation constraints, generated using the SLM in the experiment.
Modulated image: which are named as 'pp1.png'. Raw image data from a phase plate, with modulations.
Reference image: captured without modulation and object.
